# Word and Tree Languages

mappings tree to word (linearization)

## yield
tree $t$ $\mapsto$ sequence of leaves of $t$ in d.f.traversal.

regular tree language $\to$ CF word language.

## linearization

tree $t$ $\mapsto$ sequence of leaves AND inner nodes of $t$ in d.f. traversal.
every inner node is traversed twice and labeled as open or close (parenthesis) in linearization.

i.e.
tree $\mapsto$ nested word.

regular tree language $\to$ VPA language or equivalently nested-work lang.
