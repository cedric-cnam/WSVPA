#Weighted-Transducers-based Music Transcription



study of the application to MIDI2score transcription of the weighted-transducer-based approach of Mohri et al. to the computation of (string) edit-distances between (string) languages.



- [transcription.md](transcription.md) : the general picture.
- [distance-performance-score.md](distance-performance-score.md) : note on the sequential representations of symbolic performances and scores, and the computation of similarity measure between these representations.
-  [DTW.md](DTW.md) : generalities on Dynamic Time Warping, in the context of the above similarity measure comp.

- [distance-languages.md](distance-languages.md) : 

  - results (essentially Mohri et al.) on the computation of edit-distances between unweighted and weighted languages over finite alphabet 

    note: the approach supports general edit-distances defined by weighted transducers (well beyond Levenshtein)

  - comments on the generalisation to infinite alphabets
    needs appropriate generalisation of transducers.
